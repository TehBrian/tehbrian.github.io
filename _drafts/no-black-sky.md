description: "How to make your Minecraft world's horizon not ugly."
---

If you've ever gone below Y60 or so in your Minecraft world, you might've
noticed that the horizon of your beautiful sky turns black.

This is fine in *most* Minecraft worlds; however, in some scenarios, such as
void worlds, it looks terribly ugly.

People have been dealing with this problem for a while. See example
[1](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/how-to-avoid-sky-turning-black-below-y-60.367113/),
[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/i0e57d/how_do_i_get_rid_of_the_black_sky_this_is_really/).

This short post explains *why* this happens, and *how* you can fix it.

## Why does this happen?

#getHorizon

## Option 1. Install NoBlackSky

A Spigot plugin called [NoBlackSky](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/no-black-sky-1-8-8-1-18-x-for-void-world.25337/)
fixes this issue. Simply install the plugin alongside ProtocolLib, add your world
via `/nbs add <world>`, relog, and voil√°, your sky is beautiful again!

This option is great if you'd just like to get rid of that darned black sky.
However, if you'd like to learn the inner-workings of what's going on and
fix it yourself, follow along.

## Option 2. Generate worlds with world type FLAT

"But!" you might cry. "But I already generated my world! What do I do now!?" If
this is your situation, read to option 3.

## Option 3. Edit the level.dat NBT data of your world
If you've already generated, you'll have to take a different approach than simply
having generated your world with world type flat (unless you have a time machine
and can reverse your terrible mistake).

You may just want to turn back now and go with option 1. However, for the
brave-hearted of us, continue reading on.
